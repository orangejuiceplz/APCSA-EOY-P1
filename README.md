NEW IDEA

We changed our idea to make a chatroom. The premise is that the user can have two choices â†’ Make a chatroom themself or connect to the chatroom. If they make a chatroom, then they're computer will be the "host". Same thing, we're still going to make  projects and research tools. The IDE is probably going to be intellij idea. We need to utilize some sort of I/O so we can send data to and from each computer. We might store each user connected via the chatroom to an ArrayList of type People or something.

Planning on creating an extension to play games like blackjack. The host can ask if people want to play the game, etc..

The plan is that we're going to start coding some of the basic functionality of the program. We're going to start with how each of the users is stored in the server and allow for someone to host a server.
